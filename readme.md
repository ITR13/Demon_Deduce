# Demon Deduce

This project is an automatic solver for the social deduction game [**Demon Bluff**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3522600/Demon_Bluff/).

## Command Line Usage

```bash
cargo run -- <deck> <villagers> <outcasts> <minions> <demons> <card1_info> <card2_info> ...
```

### Arguments

- `<deck>`: Comma-separated list of roles in the deck
- `<villagers>`: Number of villagers in play
- `<outcasts>`: Number of outcasts in play
- `<minions>`: Number of minions in play
- `<demons>`: Number of demons in play
- `<cardN_info>`: Information for each card in format `visible:confirmed:statement`:
  - `visible`: The role shown face-up (or "?" if unknown)
  - `confirmed`: The confirmed true role (or "?" if unknown)
  - `statement`: The statement made by the card (or blank if unknown/no statement)

**Note:** All card positions are 0-indexed (one less than in-game position numbers)

### Alternative Usage

If you have `-c` or `-l` anywhere in the arguments, it will try to parse a different format from the clipboard instead. -c does it once, -l does it in loop every time it changes.
The format for this is:
- One line with a comma-separated list of the roles in the deck
- One line with 4 ints representing the villager, outcast, minion, and demon counts
- N lines in the following format: `[index]|[visible-role]|[confirmed-role]|[statement]`. Where N <= the amount of cards in play

## How It Works

It brute forces every possible starting combination and random effects, then matches that against the visible cards & statements to find out which ones are possible.

## Output

- Green: Villagers / Good
- Yellow: Outcasts
- Red: Minions / Evil
- Bright Red: Demons
